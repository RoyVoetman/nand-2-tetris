# 16-bit-computer
16-bit computer assembled purely from NAND gates

Nand 2 Tetris is a book that teaches CS students to build an entire 16-bit computer from the ground up.

The hardware projects use the simple Hardware Description Language (HDL), described in the book, and a supplied Hardware Simulator.

The software projects (assembler, virtual machine, and compiler for a simple object-based language) are developed by using the project materials available in the nand2tetris site.
