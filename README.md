# NAND-2-tetris
16-bit computer assembled purly from NAND gates

Nand 2 Tetris is a course that teaches CS students to build an entire 16-bit computer from the ground up. In the process, the students practice many major computer science (CS) abstractions studied in typical CS courses and make them concrete through 12 guided implementation projects.

The hardware projects use the simple Hardware Description Language (HDL), described in the book, and a supplied Hardware Simulator.

The software projects (assembler, virtual machine, and compiler for a simple object-based language) are developed by using the project materials available in the nand2tetris site.

## Why Bother?
Because many CS students don't understand how computers work; because fewer CS programs requires a compilation course; because many computer architecture courses are too detailed; because nothing beats the thrill of creating something from almost nothing; because Nand to Tetris engages students in implementing some of the coolest algorithms, data structures and techniques in applied computer science, and because the typical student feedback in Nand to Tetris courses is "the best course I ever took".
